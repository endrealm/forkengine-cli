# About
This is rather a templating system, then an engine. We use forkengine to create internal tools
and programs to assist development. We supply a variety of base modules that can be used for window
layouts and more. Our base modules mostly configure and assemble third party libraries in a way that 
makes it easy to get started and build on. You can customize the base modules by either contributing 
or creating custom forks and use the forks as modules (this is the reason for the name).
